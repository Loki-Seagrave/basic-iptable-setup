# basic-iptable-setup
A bash script created for a class assignment that is meant to create a stateful firewall that meets some set requirements. This included flushing the IPtables, setting new default policy, saving rules etc. Some additional aspects were added as I wanted to try to add some extra functionality, like sudo checks, rule persistence, package checks, etc.
